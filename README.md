# NLP_UNIPD

Project for a natural language processing course at Universit√† degli Studi di Padova, with Professor Giorgio Satta. 
The project, made in a group of 2 people, evolved from the lab sessions and the teorethical classes to perform neural unlabeled dependency parsing with an arc-eager parser using both an BiLSTM model and a BERT model.
The project also included the choice and analysis of a dataset, training and evaluation (UAS) of both networks and comparison and discussion of the results with SoTA results.
